# sxsw-2015-nodejs
A repository to document the workshop "Testing JavaScript Applications" from SXSW 2015.

## Official Description

So you've finally taken the advice of your peers and started writing unit tests for your JavaScript. Now what happens when you write great tests, but then realize the application's features still don't work right? Or you increase the code coverage, but still don't get the quality your users expect. How much time is spent by your QA team running the same regression tests over and over again? Does the idea of performing a manual smoke test before each code commit make you want to run for the hills? All of these issues can be addressed with a better JavaScript testing approach.

Unit and functional tests are very closely tied to agile and behavior driven development (BDD) and this workshop will walk you through how to integrate testing best practices for a more reliable development process. It will also cover the various technologies used today such as Jasmine, PhantomJS, Selenium, and Cucumber to name a few, and how to integrate these into modern JavaScript applications.

The workshop will begin with an introduction to testing and why it's so important in modern JavaScript development. We will then move into specific technologies used for testing as well as approaches for writing tests in popular JavaScript frameworks.

This workshop will include some hands on coding to introduce topics as well as demos and code samples that can be used in your own projects.

By the end of this four hour long workshop you'll have learned: 
- What is testing and why is it so important for JavaScript 
- How does testing fit into Agile and BDD workflows 
- What are the most useful technologies for setting up and executing tests 
- Some approaches for writing tests in popular JavaScript frameworks (i.e. Backbone, Angular, React, etc.) 
- Hands on practice writing your own tests
